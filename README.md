ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @claudia-a11y. 
I am passionate about accessibility and inclusivity, giving developers,testers,managers,directors real metrics and processes to not just compliance but overall better products, through Simpler UX.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring both long or short term consulting opportunities, or doing virtual or remote workshops. 
My consulting ranges from accessibility audits both code sniffing and manual, and path to remediation, and then remaining compliant.
I also do UX audits, developer hours are huge cost, auditing the UX screens/feature before development is an accelerant to market.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning leveraging containers to offer my consulting as PaaS offering
